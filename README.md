###Last Notes
1. Worked With Vue on Fronted, and Laravel as backend API
2. Worked on managing CORS,
3. Encountered Some errors <br>
    a) Posted Data is in CSV format but, everytime a new 
    request overwrites the old csv and that is not 
    desired. if we do ``fopen(filename,'a')`` 
    then the field headers are also over appended that makes the csv format bad. <br>
    b) Tried to complete the task to my level best. How ever the task is not fully complete yet. But wanted to share the source code.
